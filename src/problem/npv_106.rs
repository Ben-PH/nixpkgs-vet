            - Because {relative_package_dir} exists, the attribute `pkgs.{package_name}` must be defined like

                {package_name} = callPackage {expected_path_expr} {{ /* ... */ }};

              However, in this PR, the first `callPackage` argument is the wrong path. See the definition in {file}:{line}:

                {package_name} = callPackage {actual_path_expr} {{ /* ... */ }};
            ",
        )
    }
